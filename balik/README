2. Requirements
===============

2.1 Requirements(Updated MESSIF):
--------------------------------  
 * JDK 1.8 or higher

2.2 Requirements(Updated SimFlow):
---------------------------------
 * Perl 5 or higher with Date::Manip, Time::HiRes and Data::Dumper  
 * nfdump 1.6.3 or higher
 * R 2.15 or higher
 * lattice_0.20-13 or higher
 * MESSIF library with DBSCAN


3. Installation:
================
 1. If not provided: 
      * download MESSIF library (revision 1062, or later with same interface) from:
            ** http://mufin.fi.muni.cz/trac/messif/browser/?rev=1062&format=zip
	    ** or use the following (in directory of this README):
                    $ wget -O ./messifPatch/repository-1062.zip "http://mufin.fi.muni.cz/trac/messif/browser/?rev=1062&format=zip"
      * download SimFlow from:
            ** http://www.ics.muni.cz/~vykopal/simflow
            ** or use the following (in directory of this README):
                    $ wget -O ./simflowPatch/simflow-0.1.tar.gz http://dior.ics.muni.cz/~vykopal/simflow/simflow-0.1.tar.gz
                    $ tar -C simflowPatch/ -zxvf simflowPatch/simflow-0.1.tar.gz 
 2. Run messifPatcher.sh while you are inside messifPatch directory to update messif with DBSCAN 
    algorithm and build java application for SimFlow, MESSIF library archive should be in the same folder 
    as the messifPatcher script. Name of the zip file should be "repository-1062.zip", otherwise
    it is neccessary to change the name inside the messifPatcher script.
 3. Run simflowPatcher.sh while you are inside simflowPatch directory to update SimFlow, folder containing 
    SimFlow should be in the same directory as simflowPatcher, with name simflow-0.1.


4. Usage:
=========

4.1 Using DBSCAN in updated MESSIF:
-----------------------------------

 $ java -jar DBSCAN.jar <PATH_TO_INPUTFILE> <EPSILON> <MINPTS> <PATH_TO_OUTPUT>
 *NOTE: cluster/ will be added into <PATH_TO_OUTPUT>, if it exists it is better to erase content,
  in order to prevent errorneous output.

4.2 Using updated SimFlow (0.2):
--------------------------------
 
 $ ./simFlow.sh <path_to_scripts> <path_to_DBSCAN> <input_nfcapd_file> <filter> 
   <time_window> <scale_factor> <epsilon> <minPts> <plot_file.pdf> <ratio>
 * <path_to_DBSCAN> is path to DBSCAN.jar file (example: /path/to/db/DBSCAN.jar), other
   arguments are the same as in previous version.
   More information in simflow-0.1 README file.
  
 * To if everything was updated correctly you should be able to run following test:

  $ ./simflow-0.1/simFlow.sh ./simflow-0.1 ../messifPatch/DBSCAN.jar  "test.nfcapd" "not src net 83.187.0.0/16 or not dst net 83.187.0.0/16" "2015/10/07.03:15:00-2015/10/07.03:20:00" 30 10 10 out.pdf 5
